I modified this chatGPT tutorial to read a text file from my repo and print it from a Docker container using GitHub Actions. I am practicing with this since I do not have a local Jenkins server installed. :) 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test this setup with **GitHub Actions**, follow these steps:

### **1. Set up Your Repository:**

1. **Add your `example.txt`** file:
   - In the root of your repository, create a simple text file named `example.txt`. Add some text to it (e.g., "Hello from the text file!").

2. **Create the `Dockerfile`:**
   - In the root of your repository, create the `Dockerfile` that we discussed earlier:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM alpine:latest
     COPY example.txt .
     CMD ["cat", "example.txt"]
     ```

3. **Create the GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - In your repo, navigate to `.github/workflows/` (create the folder if it doesn’t exist).
   - Inside `.github/workflows/`, create a file named `docker-read-file.yml` and paste the following content:
     ```yaml
     name: Docker Read File Workflow

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Build Docker Image
           run: docker build -t file-reader .

         - name: Run Docker Container
           run: docker run file-reader
     ```

### **2. Commit and Push Your Changes:**
- Add the `example.txt`, `Dockerfile`, and GitHub Actions workflow (`docker-read-file.yml`) to your repo.
- Commit and push the changes to your **`main` branch** or create a new **pull request** if you’re working with branches:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow"
  git push origin main
  ```

### **3. View the Workflow Execution:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab.
3. You’ll see the workflow running under "Docker Read File Workflow" for the latest push or pull request.
4. Click on the workflow run to view its details. Under the **"Run Docker Container"** step, you should see the contents of `example.txt` printed to the console (e.g., "Hello from the text file!").

### **Expected Output in GitHub Actions:**
You should see output similar to this in the logs of the "Run Docker Container" step:

```
Hello from the text file!
```

### **That's It!**  
This simple test will verify that the **Docker container** builds and runs correctly, reading the contents of your `example.txt` file and printing them to the console.
